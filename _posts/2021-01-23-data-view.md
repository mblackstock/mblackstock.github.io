This summer I decided to get back into Node-RED development, so I started checking out some of the more intereting projects happening in the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) community.  If you aren't familiar with Node-RED it's an open source 'low-code' visual programming tool that allows users to wire together various components that communicate with devices, services and APIs.  It's built with Javascript and Node.js making it easy to extend by adding your own nodes.  

I came across a great [YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOdlPwWej98) where Node-RED is used for a machine learning application using TensorFlow.  I recommend that you check out this video and [the associated tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/building-a-machine-learning-node-for-node-red-using-tensorflowjs) if you are interested in Node-RED and ML.

## Image output node
In this demo the authors use several nodes including one based on the [node-red-contrib-image-output](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-image-output) node.  This node is useful for debugging ML applications like face detection, object recognition and others that involve images as shown.

This was the first time I'd seen live data displayed directly in a Node-RED flow.  It made me think that it would be cool to display other forms of live data within a flow, rather than in another page like a dashboard or in the Debug side bar.

As an initial step, I thought it may be worth trying to leverage the d3 library that is used by the Node-RED flow editor to display charts within the flow.  So I started the [node-red-contrib-data-view](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-data-view) node.

## Data View Node

The node-red-contrib-image-output node provided a good pattern for how this node would work.  It provided a way to draw a resizable box around a display area under a node and relay the data received from the node to the front end for display.  I decided to maintain a configurable buffer of data points for each of the nodes in the front end, and a simple way of clearing the graph by sending in null data.  A flow using the data view node is shown below.

After the initial release of this node, it prompted a [discussion on the Node-RED forum](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/node-red-contrib-data-view/38086) where several issues were raised.

## Editor is not a dashboard
One issue raised was that this node uses the flow editor not only as an editor, but also as a dashboard.  It is not clear that this is a direction that the community wants to go.  The side bar may be a better place to display data in more interesting ways.

## Do we need another charting node?
Other users didn't see the need for another charting node since the dashboard nodes provide this.  That said, a number of users thought they would find this node (and others like it) valuable as part of an extended debugging facility similar to that provided in other data flow tools.

## It's a hack
Like the image output node, this node assumes a certain implementation of the Node-RED front end, effectively hacking the node-drawing layer. By doing so, it  uses an undocumented API which will likely change over time.  This is true.  This node and others like it will need to carefully track changes to the Node-RED flow editor.

## This node will crash your browser
Another concern was that this node could crash your browser, something that you would not want to happen during flow development.  I am not sure this is an issue specific to this node since *any* node can crash either the front end or back end of Node-RED if it has bugs.

## Conclusion

Overall the feedback for the data view node has been  positive.  I received a number of bug reports and suggestions for enhancements that I have implemented and encouraged to continue to enhance and maintain this node.

I think that creating Node-RED nodes like data view and the image output node is a great way explore new applications for Node-RED such as machine learning and more easily view live data as it moves through your flows.  They help identify new requirements for Node-RED such as the development of new APIs or plug in capabilities that can reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to extend the flow editor for example.

Let me know what you think of this node and if you have any feedback, or want to contribute.
