# Introduction

Another great place to hike in the West Vancouver/Cypress area is  [Brothers Creek](https://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/brothers-creek-loop/).  This area is a maze of trails with a lot of old growth Red Cedars, waterfalls and a couple of small lakes at the higher elevations.  Rob Muir and I have been up there a number of times both in the winter this year (2021) and last summer.

# Photos

Here are a couple of photos from some of our walks.  Most of these were from January 13, 2021.  What a beautiful winter day!

This is an old Red Cedar.  I love the ropey looking trunk and the way the forest lights up in the sun.

# Painting
I was inspired to paint my impression of the forest on that sunny day.  I picked up the acrylic paints I'd set aside for some time and gave it a go.  The photo above was the inspiration for this one.  I'm looking forward to a lot more painting this summer.
