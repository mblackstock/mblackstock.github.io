I'm a software developer, researcher and entrepreneur.  Currently I am CTO and co-founder of [Sense Tecnic Systems](http://www.sensetecnic.com) (STS).  Previously, I've been a researcher at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) and worked in tech lead positions in startups in Vancouver, BC.

My current research interests include applications, tools and middleware for the Internet of Things.  Work at STS focuses on cloud-hosted and distributed data flow tools using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org). Previously I designed the Web of Things Toolkit - the WoTKit - a web centric system for managing 'things', controlling them, providing dashboard visualization tools, a processing engine and storing the data they emit.  In my PhD thesis work I proposed a common programming model for [ubiquitous computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) systems and evaluated this model by integrating several representative and well known research systems.

At UBC and previous companies I've worked on a variety of projects.  Mobile applications for citizen engagement, mobile and social network applications to encourage sustainable behaviours on campus, systems to support large scale interaction and convergence of mobile phones, situated displays and sensors, financial transaction management software, peer to peer collaboration systems, mobile enterprise middleware, mobile phone multiplayer games, and Mac OS printer drivers.
